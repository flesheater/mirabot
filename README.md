# Simple chatbot built with the help of Botman
It is a very simple chatbot built with the help of Botman (botman/botman).

It could be used as an example for anyone who just wants to download a ready botman example and start playing with the library.

## If you want to quickly install it ...
... you could just clone this repo and run 
```
composer install
```
in the root folder and then run:
```
php -S localhost:8000 -t web/
```

This way you would have the example running if you have php installed and you could test it by navigating to:
```
http://localhost:8000/widget.php
```
in your browser.

Have nice time with the Mira bot!
